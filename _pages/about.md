# 😀About Me

Hello! I'm Dongchen Liu. Welcome to my homepage. I'm a third-year undergraduate student of Tsinghua University, currently seeking reasearch mentorship for future research! 

My research interest includes machine learning and computer vision. (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tHxnJqcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

<!-- - Human gameplay is a visually grounded interaction loop in which players act, reflect on failures, and watch tutorials to refine strategies. Can Vision-Language Models (VLMs) also learn from video-based reflection?  We present \textbf{GameVerse}, a comprehensive video game benchmark that enables a \textit{reflective visual interaction loop}. Moving beyond traditional \textit{\textbf{fire-and-forget}} evaluations, it uses a novel \textit{\textbf{reflect-and-retry}} paradigm to assess how VLMs internalize visual experience and improve policies. To facilitate systematic and scalable evaluation, we also introduce a \textit{cognitive hierarchical taxonomy} spanning 15 globally popular games, \textit{dual action space} for both semantic and GUI control, and \textit{milestone evaluation} using advanced VLMs to quantify progress. Our experiments show that VLMs benefit from video-based reflection in varied settings, and perform best by combining failure trajectories and expert tutorials—a \textit{training-free} analogue to reinforcement learning (RL) plus supervised fine-tuning (SFT). -->
